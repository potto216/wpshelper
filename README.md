# Overview
The objective is to provide a set of helper functions for automation tasks using [Teledyne LeCroy's Frontline Wireless Protocol Suite](https://www.teledynelecroy.com/support/softwaredownload/psgdocuments.aspx?standardid=2&mseries=671) software that is used for wireless technology capture as well as logic and wired serial protocols. The philosophy is to keep the tools as simple as possible with a functional feel. Also internal state is exposed as much as possible to simplify modification and experimentation. Other repositories show how the code is used.

# Notes
